# Bowling Game

This application was bootstraped using [Phoenix Framework](https://www.phoenixframework.org/). To start the server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.


## Running tests
* Run `mix test`

## Relevant implementation
- [Score Calculation](https://github.com/allanpereira/shore-coding-challenge/blob/main/lib/bowling_game.ex)
- [Tests](https://github.com/allanpereira/shore-coding-challenge/blob/main/test/bowling_game/score_calculation_test.exs)

## TODOs
- [ ] Increase code coverage, adding tests and possibly fixing the implementation to edge cases.
- [ ] Implement the API itself (priority 3 in the requirements)
- [ ] Increment the information in README file
- [ ] Add the possibility to run the application using a Docker container
